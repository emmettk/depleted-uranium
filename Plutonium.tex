\title{The production of Plutonium}

\maketitle

This is a document in which we discuss the procedure necessary for the refinement of Plutonium to create nuclear weapons.

$$m_\text{Pl} = \frac{a^2}{b}$$

The atomic weight of plutonium is 244 u. The usual isotope is Pu 239. 

$$\mathscr{M} = \frac{e^{\frac{a^2}{b_{a_y}} + \sqrt{\ln(a +
      \cos(b))}}}{7}$$

The plutonium bomb, dropped on Nagasaki, was the smaller of the two
bombs dropped on Japan. 

Plutonium is too unstable to be put in close proximity with itself, so
a circular charge was used to fire the bomb by pushing the plutonium
pieces together.
